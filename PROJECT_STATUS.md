# 🚀 FinDoc Agentic AI - Project Status Report

**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Current Status:** ✅ Deployed & Fully Integrated (Backend + Frontend)

---

## 🏆 Project Overview
FinDoc is an autonomous **Agentic AI system** designed to analyze financial documents (Annual Reports, Balance Sheets). NOT just a chatbot, it uses a **Graph of Agents** to methodically:
1.  **Decompose** complex questions.
2.  **Retrieve** evidence from documents (PDFs).
3.  **Analyze** raw numbers deterministically (No LLM math errors).
4.  **Validate** findings against banking norms (RBI/SEBI).
5.  **Summarize** the final answer for financial professionals.

## ✅ Achievements & Completed Phases

### 🧱 PHASE 1: Data Infrastructure (Completed)
*   **Ingestion Engine**: Built robust PDF loader (`ingestion/loader.py`) optimized for large files (300+ pages) using **Batch Processing** and **Streaming Uploads**.
*   **Smart Chunking**: implemented logic to detect and preserve **Tables** (`[TABLE START]...`).
*   **Vector Store**: Integrated **FAISS** (In-Memory) for fast retrieval on cloud instances.

### 🧠 PHASE 2: The Agentic Brain (Completed)
*   **LangGraph Orchestration**: Implemented a state graph (`graph/graph.py`) connecting 5 specialized agents.
*   **Agent 1 (Decomposer)**: Breaks down queries into sub-tasks.
*   **Agent 2 (Retriever)**: Fetches relevant pages, ignoring marketing fluff.
*   **Agent 3 (Analyst)**:
    *   **Pure Python Math** for financial ratios (Debt-to-Equity, Interest Coverage).
    *   Extracts specific entities (Revenue, Debt, EBITDA) with Regex prioritization.
*   **Agent 4 (Validator)**:
    *   **Rule Engine** for RBI/SEBI norms (e.g., Flag High Risk if D/E > 2.0).
    *   **Dynamic Confidence Scoring**: Calculates score (0-100%) based on missing metrics, retrieval quality, and source count.
*   **Agent 5 (Summarizer)**: Synthesizes data into "Bank Report" style narratives with citations.

### 🌐 PHASE 3: API & Deployment (Completed)
*   **Cloud Deployment**: Backend successfully deployed on **Render** (`findoc-risk-engine.onrender.com`).
*   **Endpoints**: `POST /upload` (Streaming), `POST /query` (Agentic), `GET /health`.
*   **Stability**: Handled OOM (Out of Memory) issues via Generator-based processing for large PDFs.

### 🖥️ PHASE 4: Frontend UI (Completed)
*   **Streamlit Dashboard**: Professional "Bank Terminal" UI (`frontend/app.py`).
*   **Dual Mode**:
    *   **Dashboard Mode**: Quick access buttons ("Analyze Risk", "Revenue") with Financial Metrics Grid and Risk Meters.
    *   **Chat Mode**: Conversational interface for general questions with history.
*   **Visualization**: Progress bars for confidence, expandable source citations, and metric cards.

## 📍 Current Position
**The system is "Production Ready" for V1.**
Users can:
1.  Upload large Annual Reports via UI.
2.  Get instant Risk Assessments with computed confidence.
3.  View extracted Financial Metrics (Revenue, Debt) in a grid.
4.  Drill down into source page snippets.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
1.  **OCR Integration**: Re-enable Tesseract OCR for scanned/image-based PDFs (requires server with >512MB RAM).
2.  **Persistent Storage**: Move from In-Memory FAISS to Pinecone/ChromaDB to save indices across restarts.
3.  **Multi-Document Support**: Compare Q1 vs Q2 vs Q3 reports in a single query.
4.  **Export Reports**: Generate PDF/Excel download of the analyis.
